        <p>Today is the first day I'm attempting the #100DaysofCoding challenge. Or 100DaysofCode, depending on the site and who is running it. For my first project, I'm building a simple website proclaiming that I'm attempting the challenge. This page is using HTML and CSS, but no Javascript. For the first project, I wanted to focus solely on those two languages. </p>

            <p>I'm hoping that I'll be able to work some Javascript into other projects. I'd love to learn how to do image art solely using CSS, while learning more about Bootstrap and how it can really make a website 'pop'.</p>
